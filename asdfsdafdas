an abbreviated version of the word ‘pogchamp’, a popular twitch emote used to express excitement or hype. the emote originated from a bloopers reel from cross counter where the camera was knocked, and gootecks made an unusual facial expression, which became the twitch emote ‘pogchamp’. pog itself originally meant ‘play of the game’, a term used in the overwatch community, and is an achievement awarded by the game to the player for having the most points in a category by the end of the match. nowadays, ‘pog’, ‘pogchamp’ or ‘poggers are used in conversation, much the same way that the emote would be, to show excitement or hype.
